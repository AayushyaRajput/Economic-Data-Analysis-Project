# Economic-Data-Analysis-Project
The goal of this project is to analyze country-level economic affordability by comparing cost of living, rent, groceries, restaurant prices, and purchasing power indexes. This helps in understanding which countries are affordable or expensive and how different economic factors are related.

## Summary
This project analyzes the economic affordability of countries using key indexes such as Cost of Living, Rent, Groceries, Restaurant Prices, and Local Purchasing Power. With Python, we performed data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical correlation analysis, and built a simple predictive model to understand and forecast cost-related patterns across countries.

### 🔍 Key Highlights
✅ Cleaned and prepared country-level economic data
📊 Visualized top 10 countries by Cost of Living and Purchasing Power
🧮 Performed Statistical Analysis using correlation heatmaps to identify relationships between indexes
🧠 Found that Cost of Living and Purchasing Power are negatively correlated
🤖 Built a Linear Regression Model to predict Cost of Living using Rent, Groceries, Restaurant, and Purchasing Power Indexes
📈 Discovered that Groceries and Rent Index have the highest influence on the Cost of Living

### 🧰 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- pandas for data handling
- matplotlib & seaborn for visualization
- scikit-learn for predictive modeling and regression

### 🧾 Conclusion
Some countries (like Switzerland) have high living costs but also strong purchasing power. Others (like India or Pakistan) offer low costs with decent local value. This project demonstrates how simple statistical and visual analysis can uncover meaningful insights about global economic trends.
